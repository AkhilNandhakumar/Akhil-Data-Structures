#### TT0 Details
- Worked on making a menu with submenus for python
- Made the static menu, need to still make the menu using proper data structures and try/excepts

***

#### TT1 Details
- Added infoDB to menu under LISTS
- Added Fibonacci recursive to menu under NUMBERS

Python For Loops  
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).  
This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and **works more like an iterator method** as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.  
The range() Function:  
To **loop through a set of code a specified number of times**, we can use the range() function,  
The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.

Recursion means a defined function can call itself.  
The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. There must be a **termination/exit condition** that allows the function to exit without calling itself. This condition allows the recursion to stop - that is, without it the function would call itself over and over again, resulting in an error.
However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.
