### Actions:
- 5.1:
  - Benefits of the internet: Ease of comunication and collaboration in tiny amounts of time, easier to find information for learning, entertainment is easy to acces
  - Harmful effects of the internet: Can cause addiction, privacy issues for users, malware and ransomware is possible 
- 5.2
  - One can empower themselves by learning how to efficiently use tech/digital devices in order to help themselves and others. Learning how tech/computers works and programming can help understand how to use it better.
  - One can help someone become empowered in a digital world by sharing their knowledge and access to computers. I could tutor in the Library in del norte for students that may not be as skilled in using a computer to the best of their abilities.
  - Red Tape definitely hinders digital empowermnet, but doesn't block it off completely, since there are always work arounds. For example, in DNHS, many websites and features are blocked in the school internet for safety reasons, but it can be circumvented by using a hotspot or VPN. Somewhere else link China for example has a lot of internet censorship and does not allow the full potential of the internet to be seen or used by many citizens, but that can also be worked around by using special vpn's or relocating.
