## Current Project Overview and Plans:
The website focuses on providing students with 
helpful and educational resources to further 
their education. This includes several classes, 
including CSP. Our plan is to keep adding on to the 
tutoring features and services present in 
"Backpack Pro". Alongside this we also plan on 
incorporating some ideas or features requested 
by our Project Owner, such as platform-wide 
SCSS for platforms such as GitHub wikis and the 
Nighthawk Coder Society website. This would allow 
future students to access and read TPT and TT 
information without having to jump across multiple 
platforms, which would make the learning experience 
easier and more seamless We are also thinking about 
adding or creating a study calendar / organizer for 
CSP students, which would allow to plan our their 
week or studying so that they don't procrastinate or 
forget to do anything.
