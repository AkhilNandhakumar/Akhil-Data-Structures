## Documentation of Individual Achievements
During this trimester, I grew a lot in CSP. I learned about logins and authorization, CRUD, Databases, linking puthong to jinji2 in the backend, and connecting it all with Javascript and HTML on the front end. My greatest success this trimester was **implementing the Calendar linked to the Database and login**. The user is forced to login with the admin account to be able to create, read, update, and delete events on the calendar. The python and jinja checks which month is selected, and updated the events on the specific days so that each month can have unique events, using the same div elements. I also contributed with creating a custom css style sheet for out github pages so that the theme's were the same, and switching back and forth was seemless. I think that I utilized my time well this trimester and was able to accomplish a lot of our sponsor's (Mr. M) desires.

Self Score: 32/25

#### What I learned:
- adding tables within a database for organizing data
- login and authorization/forcing account sign-in on certain pages
- how to make a custom stylesheet for github pages
- custom github pages theme


#### Personal accomplishments Tangibles:
- [Calendar allowing for multiple events on one day](https://github.com/AkhilNandhakumar/Guython/commit/6674cf65316e3f1536f0eb3ca0d4fbc4f76fa27a)
- [Calendar Popup JS](https://github.com/AkhilNandhakumar/Guython/commit/2ee566da7536a595879f3544c113e33fc5ebce05)
- [Custom GH Pages Style Sheet](https://github.com/AkhilNandhakumar/Guython/blob/main/docs/gh_style.css)
- [simple blueprint for crossover team contributions](https://github.com/AkhilNandhakumar/Guython/commit/731fd2806d7a43ed8ab55f62ed6a5c5a213d996e)

## Current Project Overview and Plans:
The website focuses on providing students with 
helpful and educational resources to further 
their education. This includes several classes, 
including CSP. Our plan is to keep adding on to the 
tutoring features and services present in 
"Backpack Pro". Alongside this we also plan on 
incorporating some ideas or features requested 
by our Project Owner, such as platform-wide 
SCSS for platforms such as GitHub wikis and the 
Nighthawk Coder Society website. This would allow 
future students to access and read TPT and TT 
information without having to jump across multiple 
platforms, which would make the learning experience 
easier and more seamless We are also thinking about 
adding or creating a study calendar / organizer for 
CSP students, which would allow to plan our their 
week or studying so that they don't procrastinate or 
forget to do anything.
