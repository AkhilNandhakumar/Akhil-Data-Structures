## Quiz 1

#### Score: 49/50

#### Corrections/Reflection
- Question 1: I interpreted the question wrong, I thought it was asking how would the ability to process large data sets affect the ability to run the program. The answer was, "how many programming statements are required", which makes sense, since a large amount of tasks to accomplish would affect the ability of the program to run in a reasonable time when dealing with a large data set.
- I felt good about this test, I still need to review some facts/info about computing and computers, like encryption, IP adresses, and packets, but I will review the college board daily videos and big idea videos on friday along with working on my create task written responses to fill in this gap before the AP exam.

## Quiz 2

#### Score: 50/50

#### Corrections/Reflection:
- I was actually very surprised that I got a 50/50, because I usually make silly mistakes like mis-reading a question or evaluating an algorithm incorrectly, especially on questions that ask to choose 2 choices for algorithms that do the same steps as the original.
- The questions that were the most difficult for me was the robot question, database questions, and procedure questions. The robot one was hard because I had to keep track of the steps for 5 different procedures and check which one worked.
- The database questions contained a lot of reading, and writing down important features for each to keep track of the important ones to use in answers would save time and make answering questions easier.

## Quiz 3

#### Score: 45/50

#### Corrections/Reflection:
- **Q6**: Missclick, I forgor to click the 2nd option but I knew it was right
- **Q21**: I did not know that data mining can be used to bypass a password if the password was weak. I chose "overwhelm the system with login attempts" because I thought you can just keep trying until you get the password right since the password was weak.
- **Q24**: I didn't see that the question said "if the sensor was not activated" instead of "it was activated" which was the only error with the response.
- **Q34**: Forgot the meaning of heuristic, need to review what it means. The algorithm in the correct answer has a factorial efficiency, and it does not run in a reasonable amount of time. A heuristic approach can be used to find an approximate solution than can run in a reasonable amount of time. 
- **Q47**: The code I chose incorrectly set the bonus when the score was greater than 100, and the correct answer was D, since the code segment sets the bonus to 0 when the score is less than 50, sets the bonus to score * 10 when score is greater than 100, and sets bonus to score when 100 is greater than or eqal to score which is greater than or equal to 50.

## Quiz 5

#### Score: 25/25

#### Corrections/Reflection:
- I was iffy on the encryption question, but the rest felt pretty good. I'm going to look over the ap csp quizlet to review encryption and I should feel comfortable for the exam.
