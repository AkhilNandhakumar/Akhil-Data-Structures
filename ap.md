## Quiz 1

#### Score: 49/50

#### Corrections/Reflection
- Question 1: I interpreted the question wrong, I thought it was asking how would the ability to process large data sets affect the ability to run the program. The answer was, "how many programming statements are required", which makes sense, since a large amount of tasks to accomplish would affect the ability of the program to run in a reasonable time when dealing with a large data set.
- I felt good about this test, I still need to review some facts/info about computing and computers, like encryption, IP adresses, and packets, but I will review the college board daily videos and big idea videos on friday along with working on my create task written responses to fill in this gap before the AP exam.

## Quiz 2

#### Score: 50/50

#### Corrections/Reflection:
- I was actually very surprised that I got a 50/50, because I usually make silly mistakes like mis-reading a question or evaluating an algorithm incorrectly, especially on questions that ask to choose 2 choices for algorithms that do the same steps as the original.
- The questions that were the most difficult for me was the robot question, database questions, and procedure questions. The robot one was hard because I had to keep track of the steps for 5 different procedures and check which one worked.
- The database questions contained a lot of reading, and writing down important features for each to keep track of the important ones to use in answers would save time and make answering questions easier.
